# Graphs, Hash table from scratch, Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm
 First a 2-D graph of vertices and edges is created to model the distances between addresses of physical locations, then Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm is used to calculate the shortest route the next address, recalculatinig after each vertex is visited. This app minimizes distance traveled, offering a solution for a variation on the Traveling Salesman Problem.

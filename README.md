# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm is applied to a graph, a self-adjusting Hash Table is made to store ‘package’ data, and deliveries are made using Nearest Neighbor Heuristics.
 A graph of vertices and edges is created to model the distances between addresses of physical locations, imported from a .csv file, then Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm is used to calculate the shortest route to the next address, recalculating after each vertex is visited. This app minimizes distance traveled, offering a solution for a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem.
